## Description
This is a program that reads input from a file and
then converts said input into a doubly linked list. 
This list is then traversed/sorted either first to 
last item, or last to first item. The user then may 
choose to either output the sorted list to the command 
line or to an output file of their choosing.

## Installation
Requires C compiler.

## Credits
